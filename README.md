# Green Academy API - Final Phase: Testing, Deployment, and Refinement

## Scenario
This summative assessment builds upon the API developed and enhanced in Formative Assessments 1 and 2. The focus now shifts to rigorous testing, professional deployment, and final refinements. The goal is to ensure the API is robust, secure, performant, and readily accessible.

## Instructions
This group assignment (group of 2) requires you to finalize the Green Academy API by implementing thorough testing strategies, deploying the API to a suitable environment, and addressing any remaining refinements.

---

## Part 1: Comprehensive Testing (40%)
Develop a comprehensive testing suite for your API, including:

### Unit Tests
- Expand unit tests covering critical functionalities such as authentication, authorization, input validation, data access, and error handling.
- Aim for high test coverage using a testing framework like `pytest`.

### Integration Tests
- Implement integration tests to verify interactions between different API components (e.g., views, serializers, models).

### Security Testing
- Conduct security testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like **Postman**, **OWASP ZAP**, or similar to test for:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Broken Authentication
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs)
- Document the tests performed and the results.

### Performance Testing
- Evaluate API responsiveness and scalability using tools like **Locust**, **k6**, or simple timing scripts.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.

### API Documentation Verification
- Review and verify the accuracy and completeness of API documentation.
- Ensure all endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, error codes, and examples are correctly documented.

---

## Part 2: Deployment (40%)
Deploy your API to a suitable environment, such as **PythonAnywhere** or a similar cloud platform.

### Deployment Platform Selection
- Justify your choice of deployment platform based on ease of use, scalability, cost, and security.

### Deployment Process
- Document the steps involved in deploying the API, including specific instructions and commands.

### Configuration
- Explain how you configured the API for the deployment environment (e.g., environment variables, database settings).
- Emphasize secure configuration practices.

### Monitoring
- Describe how the deployed API will be monitored for performance, errors, and security issues.
- Mention tools or strategies for monitoring.

---

## Part 3: Refinement and Polish (20%)
Finalize your API with the following refinements:

### Code Review and Refactoring
- Conduct a thorough code review and refactor unclear, inefficient, or difficult-to-maintain code.

### Performance Optimization
- Implement any performance optimizations identified during testing.

### Security Hardening
- Apply necessary security hardening measures based on security test results.

### Documentation Polish
- Ensure API documentation is clear, comprehensive, and easy to navigate.
- Add any missing information or examples.

### README Enhancement
- Provide clear instructions for setting up, running, testing, and deploying the API.
- Include a summary of the API's features and any known limitations.

---

## Deliverables
- A **GitHub repository** containing the final project code.
- A well-structured `README.md` file with:
  - Detailed setup, running, testing, and deployment instructions.
  - Summary of API features and known limitations.
  - Changelog of improvements made throughout the project.
- A separate `TESTING_REPORT.md` detailing:
  - Testing strategies used
  - Results of tests (including performance metrics and security testing results)
  - Issues identified and addressed
- A `DEPLOYMENT.md` file documenting:
  - Deployment process
  - Configuration
  - Monitoring strategies
